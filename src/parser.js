  TODO:
    1. Make a function that accepts tokens and returns ATS.
      Use operator precedence parsing.
      * Associate every token with left binding power and operational function
      * If the operator manipulates tokens to its left, 
        associate it with a left denotative function. 
        If the operator does not manipulate the tokens on its left, 
        associate it with a null denotative function. 
        Identifiers and numbers also have a nud function associated with them.
